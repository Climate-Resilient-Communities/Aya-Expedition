This variability is influenced by various factors, including the solar cycle, stratospheric conditions, and oceanic circulation patterns, which can lead to chaotic and unpredictable fluctuations or more cyclic and predictable changes. \n\nClimate models simulate these real-world phenomena, but the statistical properties can differ. An example is illustrated in Figure 2, showcasing how annual temperature means and moving averages fluctuate without the influence of long-term trends, such as those that would be caused by increasing greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n- Natural climate variability is caused by a combination of chaotic and cyclic factors, resulting in unpredictable and predictable fluctuations, respectively. \n- Climate models help us understand and simulate these phenomena, providing valuable insights into the complex behavior of our climate system.", "## 1.2 Climate Change": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided section of the climate change report: \n\n- Climate change refers to long-term variations in temperature and climate conditions, which are often obscured by short-term natural climate variability. \n- To discern clear climate change signals, data must be averaged over extended periods, as illustrated by the annual mean temperature data in Figure 2, which fluctuates annually. \n- The impact of natural variability means that short-term trends may not always align with the overall projected trends due to climate change, as demonstrated in Figure 3. \n- As such, it is important to be cautious when interpreting trends calculated over a small number of years, as they may not accurately reflect long-term climate change patterns. \n\nOverall, the report emphasizes the need to consider long-term data and trends when analyzing climate change, as short-term variations can often be misleading.", "## Climate Normals": "Climate normals are essential averages that provide a snapshot of an area's past climate. These are not to be confused with reference periods, which are simulation-derived. Climate normals are calculated using temperature and precipitation observations, some dating back to the 19th century, and other climate variables. A 30-year timeframe is commonly used for these calculations, endorsed by the WMO, to ensure consistency across studies. \n\n- Climate normals provide a baseline for understanding an area's climate, with a focus on long-term conditions, avoiding the influence of short-term variability. \n- The choice of baseline period depends on the specific study, but a longer period, such as 30 years, helps to smooth out any short-term trends and provides a more accurate representation of the climate. \n- The use of observed data, rather than simulations, is a key feature of climate normals, although satellite data is also available for more recent periods.", "## 1.3 Climate Models": "Climate models are powerful tools that use mathematical equations and supercomputers to simulate and understand Earth's complex climate system. These models divide the planet into grid cells, solving equations for each to represent interactions between the atmosphere, land, oceans, and more. The key points are as follows:\n\n- Climate models differ in their numerical schemes, simplifications, grid resolutions, and parameterizations of small-scale phenomena.\n- Unique soil textures, vegetation types, topography, and GHG concentrations influence model inputs and outcomes.\n- There are two main types of climate models: Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs).\n- GCMs cover the entire planet with a horizontal resolution of ~200 km and have evolved to include the atmosphere, oceans, and now biogeochemical interactions like the carbon cycle.\n- RCMs focus on smaller regions, allowing for finer resolution (~45 km), but require data from GCMs or reanalyses to drive their boundary conditions.\n\nIn summary, climate models provide a crucial tool for scientists to understand and predict global climate change, each with unique characteristics and contributions to our understanding of Earth's complex climate system.", "## Model Resolution": "It is understandable that people may assume that more detailed information leads to better insights and decision-making. This belief can influence the preference for using regional climate models or statistically downscaled data over global climate model outputs. However:\n\n- It is crucial to evaluate multiple factors when choosing between data types as higher resolution does not always equate to superior model performance or more useful insights. \n- While increased resolution can provide a more intricate representation of topographic characteristics, it may not offer significant advantages for all variables. \n- The enhanced representation of topographic features can be particularly valuable for variables associated with extreme events. \n\nIn summary, while higher resolution can provide benefits for specific variables and extreme event analysis, it is not a guarantee of improved model performance or decision-usefulness across the board.", "## 1.4 Emissions Scenarios": "The emission of greenhouse gases is a key component of climate change and its numerical simulation. Data on these emissions come from past observations and future projections, the latter of which is based on emissions scenarios. These scenarios outline possible future releases of greenhouse gases and are based on assumptions about technological, demographic, and socioeconomic factors, as well as mitigation policies. The choice of emission scenario significantly impacts the uncertainty of climate projections, particularly for the latter half of the 21st century. Currently, emissions scenario development is advancing alongside climate model development, with researchers evaluating future emission trajectories to inform climate model simulations. The latest emissions scenarios, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), were used in the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report and offer a range of outcomes based on different socioeconomic and technological development scenarios. The four RCP families project varying levels of radiative forcing and resulting changes in global surface temperatures by 2100.", "## Emissions Scenarios Over Time": "The report outlines the evolution of emissions scenarios used in climate modeling, introducing RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) as an update to the earlier SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) scenarios. These scenarios are key inputs for climate models, with RCPs offering a more nuanced view of potential future pathways. Table 1 and Figure 5 compare RCPs and SRES, highlighting temperature anomalies, radiative forcing, and CO2 concentration equivalents. The RCPs range from aggressive mitigation (RCP2.6) to a high-emissions future (RCP8.5), with corresponding temperature increases. The IPCC's assessment reports use these scenarios, with the most recent (Fifth Assessment Report) utilizing observations up to 2005 and emissions scenarios beyond that. The time lag between observations and their inclusion in reports is due to the time-consuming nature of climate simulations and the scientific publication process.", "## 1.5 Climate Simulations": "Climate simulations are a key tool in understanding and predicting climate change. These simulations are the product of complex climate models, which use various inputs and equations to project future climate scenarios. The inputs include detailed Earth surface data and emission scenarios, which drive the model's response. \n\n- Climate simulations are not predictions but plausible future climate projections based on different models and greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing scenarios. \n- Simulations cover different time spans, from a few years to millennia, for past and future periods. \n- They are computed at different time intervals or \"time steps,\" which define the temporal resolution, typically ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. \n- Each simulation provides data on over a hundred climate variables, ensuring physical consistency across space and time. \n- The length of time for simulations varies among climate centers, with some running from 1850/1900 to 2100 or even 2300. \n\nThese simulations offer a powerful means to understand and prepare for potential climate change outcomes.", "## Model Bias": "Climate models are essential tools for understanding and predicting climate change, but they are not perfect representations of the complex climate system. These models rely on mathematical equations and simulations to approximate the real world, and as a result, there are inherent imperfections and biases in the output. \n\n- The output of a climate model simulation will differ from actual meteorological records, and this is expected due to the chaotic and sensitive nature of the climate system. \n- Even with accurate historical data as input, a model's response will not precisely match the observed succession and timing of meteorological events. \n- Climate models aim to reproduce the statistical properties of observed records, such as mean, variance, and inter-annual variability. \n- Each model has its own unique bias, resulting in variations among models, such as projected temperatures and precipitation amounts. \n- These biases are important considerations when calculating climate change scenarios and can vary across different regions of the globe. \n- Both Global Climate Models (GCMs) and Regional Climate Models (RCMs), as well as gridded observations, exhibit these biases. \n\nIn summary, while climate models provide valuable insights, their limitations and biases must be carefully considered to develop robust climate change scenarios and inform decision-making.", "# Simulation: Past And Future": "Here is a summary of the key points from the climate change report section: \n\n- The figure presents global annual mean surface air temperature anomalies, showcasing the deviation from the 1986-2005 mean temperature. These anomalies are projected based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which represent potential future scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations. \n\n- The solid lines indicate the multi-model mean temperature anomalies, while the shading represents the range of temperature anomalies across individual models, with the 5th to 95th percentiles shown (\u00b1 1.64 standard deviation). \n\n- The projections suggest that global temperatures are likely to continue rising under all RCP scenarios, with the magnitude of warming dependent on the pathway. The range of temperature anomalies widens towards the end of the century, indicating increasing uncertainty. \n\n- The discontinuities in 2100 are artifacts of the modeling process and do not represent actual temperature changes. The number of models contributing to the projections varies over time, as indicated in the figure. \n\n- Overall, this figure illustrates the expected global warming trends under different emissions scenarios, highlighting the potential for significant temperature increases in the future.", "## 1.6 Climate Projections": "Climate projections offer a glimpse into the future of our climate, outlining the potential changes to various climate variables over the coming decades and centuries. These projections are based on emissions scenarios, which describe the potential future emissions of greenhouse gases. The starting point of these projections is the year when emissions scenarios diverge from observed GHG emissions data, offering a 'what-if' scenario of potential future climate outcomes:\n\n- The climate projections paint a picture of Canada's future climate, providing insights into how various climate variables may evolve over time under different emissions scenarios.\n- These projections are a key tool for understanding and preparing for the potential impacts of climate change, helping us to visualize and plan for the future.\n- By running climate models based on emissions scenarios, scientists can predict how the climate system may behave and change over the long term.\n- The starting point of these projections is a critical pivot point, marking the year when potential future emissions scenarios diverge from our current, observed reality.", "## Ensemble Members": "By utilizing a variety of models and emissions scenarios, a broad range of potential future climate outcomes can be predicted for Canada. This method, known as ensemble modeling, involves running models multiple times with slight variations, such as different start dates, to account for the chaotic nature of the climate system. These small changes can lead to significantly different outcomes, providing a range of possible future climates. This technique is particularly useful for understanding the potential impacts of climate change in Canada, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the potential future climate scenarios that the country may face. \n\n- Ensemble modeling offers a way to predict a broad range of future climate outcomes.\n- Running models multiple times with slight variations accounts for the chaotic nature of the climate system.\n- This technique is valuable for understanding potential climate change impacts in Canada.", "## 1.6.1 Coupled Model Intercomparaison Project (Cmip)": "The global climate modeling community has come together to form the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which provides a collaborative framework for climate modeling centers to share their simulations and create a comprehensive ensemble of climate data. This initiative is essential due to the computationally intensive nature of running climate simulations, which can take months even with powerful supercomputers. \n\n- The CMIP ensemble is the foundation of the IPCC reports, and it evolves as models and emissions scenarios are updated. \n- The current version, CMIP5, utilizes the latest RCP emissions scenarios and offers higher spatial resolution and improved physical parameterizations compared to its predecessor, CMIP3. \n- While direct comparisons between CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections are challenging due to differences in GHG scenarios, studies indicate that both ensembles yield similar results for temperature and precipitation changes under comparable forcing. \n- The gradual shift towards CMIP5 is supported by its better agreement with observed past climate simulations. \n- Furthermore, the use of an ensemble of models is reinforced by the finding that a single model may not perform as well as the ensemble average when validated against multiple observations.", "## Cmip5 Vs Cmip3": "The reliability of climate change models is crucial for understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change. While newer models are often considered more reliable due to their incorporation of the latest knowledge and processes, older models still hold value. \n\n- The report emphasizes that the interpretation of climate information is largely independent of the specific models or scenarios used. \n- It is important to consider both the newest and older generations of models, such as the CMIP5 and CMIP3 ensembles, to gain a comprehensive understanding. \n- The validity of impact studies should not be dismissed based on the age of the simulations used. \n- This section of the climate change report for Canada aims to provide a guide to interpreting climate information, utilizing both new and old model simulations to ensure a robust understanding of the climate system.", "## 1.7 Sources Of Uncertainty In Climate Projections": "The evolution of Canada's climate is influenced by natural fluctuations, model inaccuracies, and future greenhouse gas emissions trajectories, with natural variability being the most significant source of uncertainty in the near term. This variability can mask the climate change signal in the short term, making it challenging to distinguish between natural variations and long-term trends associated with anthropogenic climate change. However, over longer periods, the choice of emission scenario becomes crucial in shaping the climate trajectory. While model uncertainties remain significant regardless of the decision-making timeframe, stakeholders are already accustomed to navigating short-term weather and climate variability, as well as uncertainties in other areas of their operations. \n\nWhen making decisions, it is essential to understand the primary sources of uncertainty and their changing importance over time. For near-term planning, natural variability in regional observations takes precedence, while also considering the underlying climate change signal for long-term sustainability. In contrast, for longer planning horizons, the focus should be on emissions scenario uncertainties, as the climate change signal becomes more pronounced and heavily influenced by the chosen scenario.", "## 1.8 Simulation Ensemble": "Climate service providers cannot offer a single, definitive climate change scenario for decision-making. This is due to the inherent complexities of climate models and the uncertain future of greenhouse gas emissions. The best approach is to consider a range of possible outcomes, including best- and worst-case scenarios, by utilizing a simulation ensemble. This involves a large number of simulations, with general guidelines recommending as many models and emission scenarios as possible. \n\nThe choice of the number of simulations depends on time and resource constraints and should be informed by climate service provider expertise. Statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, can help select a manageable number of simulations that represent the full range of future conditions. This method involves choosing climate variables, calculating climatic change, and using an algorithm to find distances between simulations. Ultimately, a combination of user input, provider expertise, and statistical methods helps determine the most appropriate scenarios for specific planning exercises.", "## Limitations Of Selection": "It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of climate change simulations. These models are often selected based on specific climate indices, such as annual temperature and precipitation data, and may not accurately represent other important factors like snow cover over different time frames. The validity of these simulations is contingent on the specific indices and temporal scales employed in their creation. This highlights the challenge of capturing the full complexity of climate change and the need to carefully consider the limitations of any given model when interpreting results and making decisions. \n\n- The selection of climate change simulations is based on limited climate indices, like annual temperature and precipitation.\n- These may not represent other important factors, such as snow cover, over different time periods.\n- Validity is restricted to the specific indices and temporal scales used in the selection process.\n- This limitation underscores the complexity of climate change and the need to interpret results cautiously.", "## 1.9 Downscaling Techniques": "Climate models (CMs) are essential tools for understanding and projecting climate change. Global Climate Models (GCMs) simulate the entire planet's climate system but have a coarse resolution of 100-300 km. To address the demand for more detailed local information, downscaling techniques are applied: \n\n- Dynamical downscaling uses Regional Climate Models (RCMs) with finer resolutions (10-50 km) to improve the representation of land surface features and refine climate characteristics for a specific region. This method is computationally expensive but ensures spatiotemporal consistency. \n\n- Statistical downscaling, on the other hand, establishes statistical relationships between local climate observations and large-scale global climate variables (predictors). This approach is quicker and less costly but assumes stationary climate conditions, which may not hold true in a changing climate. \n\nBoth techniques play a crucial role in providing finer-scale climate projections, aiding in the understanding of climate change impacts and informing adaptation and mitigation strategies.", "## 1.9.1 When Is Downscaling Necessary": "Downscaling climate data to a finer resolution may provide more detailed information for localized adaptation strategies. However, it doesn't guarantee improved model performance across all variables and time frames. The decision to downscale depends on the specific climate variables and landscape features being considered:\n\n- The impact of surface characteristics like topography and coastlines varies for each climate variable and can change seasonally.\n- While downscaling may enhance the accuracy of certain variables, such as precipitation, it might not offer significant benefits for analyzing temperature over larger regions.\n- The additional time required to process finer-scale data should also be considered when deciding whether to downscale.\n\nIn summary, while downscaling can provide more detailed information for localized decision-making, it should be selectively applied based on the specific variables, regional characteristics, and time frames in question.", "## Downscaling And Bias Correction (Post-Processing)": "Downscaling and bias correction are distinct but interconnected concepts in climate change analysis. \n\n- Downscaling refers to techniques that increase the spatial resolution of climate data, with two primary methods: statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling. \n- Bias correction, on the other hand, is a post-processing technique used to adjust for biases in climate models. \n- The confusion arises because statistical downscaling often includes a bias correction step, and dynamical downscaling outputs are sometimes bias-corrected. \n- However, it is important to distinguish that bias correction is not inherent to the downscaling process but is rather a separate tool used to enhance the accuracy of climate models. \n\nThus, while related, downscaling and bias correction serve unique purposes in the broader context of climate change research and should not be considered interchangeable.", "## 1.9.2 Dynamical Or Statistical Downscaling": "The choice between downscaling methods for climate modelling is complex and depends on various factors. Climate service providers must consider the advantages and limitations of both statistical and dynamical downscaling techniques. \n\nStatistical downscaling treats each climate variable individually, which can disrupt the physical coherence between them. It relies on local meteorological observations and assumes these relationships will remain constant, which may not be valid for long-term projections. However, it offers a larger number of projections and is quicker and less expensive. \n\nOn the other hand, dynamical downscaling maintains consistency among variables and reproduces detailed climate characteristics. It is more costly and time-consuming, and there are fewer regional simulations available. The choice between the two methods depends on the specific study requirements and resources. An ensemble of projections may favor statistical downscaling, while a smaller, carefully selected sample may lean towards dynamical downscaling.", "## 1.10 Post-Processing Techniques": "Climate models, including GCMs and RCMs, often introduce biases when estimating climate variables, necessitating post-processing to make the data more user-friendly and accurate. This step is crucial when calculating future simulated values, as model biases can significantly impact threshold values. For instance, a model with a warm bias may overestimate the number of days with temperatures above 30\u00b0C, influencing decision-makers' conclusions. Post-processing aims to correct these biases, ensuring that climate data is reliable and usable.

The costs associated with climate change fall into several categories, each with its own unique impact: direct costs, such as those from flood damage, are tangible and immediate; indirect costs, like service disruptions, have a knock-on effect; and then there are the macroeconomic impacts, including reduced GDP growth, and the welfare losses shouldered by affected communities. \n\n- Adaptation measures can provide benefits beyond climate resilience, but they may also come with unforeseen costs. \n- The variety of terms used to describe these economic impacts, often interchangeably, can cause confusion and hinder effective decision-making. \n- This report aims to provide clear definitions and context for these cost and benefit terms to improve understanding and facilitate informed choices when comparing adaptation strategies. \n\nThe summary above distills the key points from the provided text, offering a concise overview of the economic and social landscape shaped by climate change, and the challenges and opportunities presented by adaptation actions.", "## 6.3.1 Direct And Indirect Costs": "The economic consequences of climate change in Canada can be categorized into direct and indirect costs, each with positive and negative outcomes. Direct costs are tangible and intangible damages with observable prices or \"shadow prices\" for non-market goods. These include repairs, medical treatment, and lost revenue, as well as harder-to-quantify costs like ecosystem service losses and reduced quality of life. Indirect costs arise from direct impacts and include business interruption costs and wider economic multiplier effects. They often persist over longer periods and larger areas than direct costs. Properly assessing the total economic impact of climate change requires considering all relevant direct and indirect costs, especially significant non-market impacts. The net result of these costs and their overall effect on Canada's economy is a critical area of focus.\n\n- Direct costs: arise from physical impacts, including tangible (e.g., repairs, medical costs) and intangible losses (e.g., ecosystem services, quality of life).\n- Intangible items: assigned \"shadow prices\" to estimate their value.\n- Indirect costs: stem from direct impacts and include business interruptions and wider economic effects.\n- Time and scale: Indirect costs often span longer periods and larger areas than direct physical impact sites.\n- Total economic impact: considering all direct and indirect, market, and non-market costs is crucial for understanding climate change's full economic consequences.\n- Net result: The overall sum of positive and negative impacts, whether net costs or benefits, is a key focus.", "## 6.3.2 Macroeconomic Costs": "The economic impacts of climate change in Canada are far-reaching and complex. Here are the key points: \n\n- Climate change can impact macroeconomic indicators like consumer prices, unemployment, and GDP, with potential ripple effects on investment and consumption. \n- Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models and supply and use tables can estimate these impacts, offering a comprehensive view of the direct and indirect market costs. \n- While projected changes in indicators like GDP provide insight, they are just one aspect of understanding the consequences. Other direct and indirect costs must be considered separately to avoid double-counting. \n- The effects of climate change are often localized, and aggregate indicators may not capture the severity of impacts on specific communities, particularly disadvantaged ones. \n- Finally, aggregate indicators can mask uneven impacts, where losses in one region are offset by gains elsewhere. \n\nIn summary, the economic implications of climate change are multifaceted and require a nuanced approach that considers both aggregate and localized impacts.", "## 6.3.3 Welfare Losses": "- While the theoretical measure of economic impact from climate change is the change in welfare of affected populations, this is difficult to estimate in practice. \n- As a result, GDP is often used as a proxy for welfare, despite its limitations. \n- However, GDP only captures the value of market goods and services and does not account for non-market impacts, which can be substantial. \n- It is important to consider that GDP increases after extreme events due to increased investment in repairs, while welfare may actually decrease as consumption and consumer surplus are reduced. \n- A more accurate measure of the welfare costs of climate change would be consumption loss rather than GDP loss. \n- Despite these concerns, the monetary cost of climate change is often expressed as a percentage of projected GDP, known as a GDP-equivalent impact. \n\nIn summary, while GDP is a commonly used metric, it is an imperfect measure of the economic consequences of climate change, and consumption loss may be a more accurate indicator of the welfare costs incurred by affected populations.", "## 6.3.4 Co-Benefits And Other Co-Impacts": "When making decisions about adapting to climate change, it is crucial to consider the economic impacts and potential co-benefits. Adaptation options can have various ancillary impacts, known as co-impacts, which may be positive or negative and intentional or unintentional. Recognizing co-impacts is important as it can motivate people to take action on climate change when they understand the specific impacts associated with certain actions. Adaptation options that reduce climate-related damages can also contribute to other benefits such as GHG emissions reduction, economic development, public health improvements, sustainability, and equity. For example, green roofs in cities can reduce urban heat, manage stormwater, sequester carbon, and enhance biodiversity, providing multiple co-benefits. Negative co-impacts, or co-costs, can include increased GHG emissions, heightened risks for unaffected groups or sectors, and limited future adaptation choices. Understanding and weighing these co-impacts are vital when making informed decisions about adaptation strategies.", "## 6.3.5 Private And Social Costs": "The economic assessment of adaptation options to climate change can be viewed from two main perspectives: a social perspective and a private perspective. \n\n- The social perspective, often adopted by public policymakers, aims for a socially optimal allocation of resources and considers a broader range of factors, including co-benefits, negative consequences, lifecycle costs, and avoided damages. \n\n- On the other hand, the private perspective, typically considered by households and businesses, focuses on a narrower set of private costs and benefits (financial impacts) that directly affect the individual decision-maker and are often based on market prices. \n\nAn example of the difference between the two perspectives is provided, illustrating how the cost of a flood event is borne differently by the affected homeowner (private cost) compared to the broader society (social cost) when government aid is involved. \n\nOverall, the choice of perspective significantly shapes the evaluation of adaptation options and the distribution of costs and benefits in the context of climate change responses.", "## Case Story 6.1: Climate Action By Cities Around The World Is Resulting In Co-Benefits": "A 2015 London School of Economics report on urban climate action co-benefits identified numerous advantages across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with specific policy actions in mind.

Since the 1970s, the federal DFAA program's annual costs have increased, with payouts for hurricanes, storms, and floods rising from $56 million to $427 million annually between 1995 and 2014. This trend indicates a growing adaptation deficit, which is expected to worsen with climate change. Early adaptation efforts are crucial to address this deficit and mitigate future risks. The data also reveals the widespread impact of climate-related events, affecting various provinces and resulting in diverse weather-related challenges, including fires, storms, flooding, and hail.", "## 6.4.4 What Is Influencing Growing Losses?": "The debate surrounding the role of climate change in increasing weather-related disaster losses is complex. Scholars argue for the necessity of \"loss normalization\" to account for socioeconomic factors when comparing historical and recent disasters. This process, adjusting for factors like population and wealth growth, reveals that the rising trend in losses is primarily due to an accumulation of value over time. While some studies find no significant upward trends in normalized losses, others detect long-term increases, particularly in extreme events. Canada's insured losses from weather disasters show a positive trend even after normalization, indicating that while growing exposures and asset values contribute significantly, climate change may also play a role. Event attribution research supports this, linking climate change to specific extreme weather events in Canada, including the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire and the 2013 southern Alberta flooding.

With climate change posing a significant threat, the TE2100 project aims to develop a long-term strategic plan to safeguard the city until 2100. An adaptation pathways approach is adopted to address deep uncertainties regarding future extreme water levels and the high irreversible costs involved. \n\n- Four potential packages of adaptation actions, or High-Level Options (HLOs), are proposed, each offering flexibility to adapt to varying rates of sea-level rise. \n- HLO1, for instance, provides protection up to 2.3m of sea-level rise, while HLO4, involving the construction of a new barrage, caters to the \"worst-case\" projection of a 4.3m rise. \n- Crucial to this approach is defining \"decision points\" in advance, where irreversible options need to be chosen based on key indicators like extreme water levels. \n- A formal economic appraisal, considering monetized and non-monetized impacts, recommends improving the existing protection system as a low-regret measure for the first 60 years. \n- The plan will be reviewed every 10 years, with a crucial decision point in 2050 to ensure a cost-efficient and timely response to the challenges posed by climate change and sea-level rise. \n\nThis adaptive strategy allows decision-makers to accumulate knowledge, manage uncertainties, and make informed choices to protect London from flooding.", "## 6.6.4.2 Discounting Choices": "Climate change adaptation strategies require upfront investments, and the benefits or costs of these investments play out over time. Discounting is a practice that assigns weights to future impacts, helping to compare costs and benefits occurring at different times. The key concept is the discount rate, which determines how much influence future costs and benefits have on present values. A higher rate means future impacts are valued less in the present. \n\nThere are two main approaches to discounting: the prescriptive approach, based on ethical and policy considerations, and the descriptive approach, based on opportunity costs and actual investment decisions. The choice of rate and whether it should remain constant over time are debated. Canada's Treasury Board recommends a 3% social discount rate for long-term regulations, while the descriptive rate is 8%. Scholars argue for declining discount rates over time, and some countries like the UK and France have adopted this approach for public investment appraisal. \n\nCanada's economic appraisals of adaptation actions typically use a 3-4% discount rate, kept constant over time. This suggests a focus on long-term benefits and a prescriptive approach to valuing future impacts.", "## Horizons Of 50 To 100 Years.": "- When evaluating investments in climate change adaptation in Canada, the choice of discount rate is less critical than it is for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction projects.\n- Adaptation actions often have shorter time horizons, with costs and benefits realized over decades rather than centuries.\n- \"Flow\" adaptation actions, where costs and benefits occur simultaneously, further shorten the time perspective.\n- Decision-makers typically operate within prescribed discount rates for specific contexts, which helps standardize comparisons between different adaptation options.\n- Understanding the impact of different discount rates on economic appraisals is crucial to ensure like-for-like comparisons when evaluating alternative adaptation strategies.\n\nOverall, while discount rates are important, other factors such as timing, sequencing, and standardized comparisons play a more significant role in appraising adaptation investments.", "## 6.6.4.3 Distributional Considerations": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- Aggregating the costs and benefits of climate change adaptation measures is crucial for decision-makers, especially considering that vulnerable communities, such as low-income and disadvantaged groups, face higher risks and have limited adaptive capacities.\n\n- The Canadian Cost-Benefit Analysis Guide emphasizes the need for distributional analysis, assessing how proposed regulations impact different stakeholder categories, including business size, income, age, region, and gender.\n\n- While political considerations may influence trade-offs between an action's net present value and distributional impacts, there are approaches that integrate distributional dimensions. One such method, dating back to the 1950s, involves using equity weights to reflect the relative value of benefits or costs to lower-income groups.\n\n- The literature suggests a renewed interest in incorporating equity considerations into economic appraisals of climate change impacts and adaptation measures, ensuring that vulnerable communities are not disproportionately affected.\n\n- However, the application of equity weights in traditional economic analysis is uncommon, and none of the examined economic appraisals of adaptation actions in Canada explicitly considered distributional issues.\n\nThe summary highlights the importance of considering the distribution of costs and benefits of climate change adaptation, especially for vulnerable communities, and the potential role of equity weights in economic analyses.", "## 6.7 The Benefits Of Adaptation Actions In Canada Outweigh The Costs": "Here is a summary of the key points from the climate change report section: \n\n- The economic benefits of proactive adaptation to climate change in Canada typically outweigh the costs, presenting a strong case for early investment.\n- Using traditional cost-benefit analysis (CBA), studies show that for every dollar spent on adaptation, an average of $5.60 in benefits is returned, with soft adaptations often providing better returns than hard engineering solutions.\n- However, even with adaptations in place, residual damage costs are often still incurred, indicating economic limits to adaptation and the need to complement it with robust mitigation efforts.\n- The effectiveness of adaptation actions is highly context-specific, varying across locations and circumstances, emphasizing the importance of localized solutions. \n\nOverall, the report section underscores the strong business case for adaptation in Canada, while also highlighting the complexity and limitations of adapting to climate change impacts.", "## 6.7.1 Economic Analysis Of Adaptation Options In Canada": "The literature on adaptation costs and benefits in Canada is limited, covering only a few sectors and a narrow range of climate change impacts.

The latter is particularly notable, as health impacts can be economically significant.\n- Specific regions of Canada, such as the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Prairie provinces, are underrepresented in the available studies.\n- While cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is commonly used in the existing literature, there is a lack of diversity in economic evaluation methods, with no applications of ceiling testing, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), or newer tools like robust decision-making (RDM) and resilience options analysis (ROA). \n- Two notable studies by Girard (2018) assessed the economic impacts of adaptation actions for winter roads in Northern Ontario and coastal flooding in New Brunswick, finding that building all-season roads was inefficient, while near-term flood reduction measures provided significant benefits.\n- The body of evidence on the benefits and costs of adaptation actions in Indigenous communities is scarce but is being addressed through programs like First Nation Adapt. \n\nOverall, while there is a growing body of evidence on the benefits and costs of climate change adaptation in Canada, more diverse and comprehensive research is needed to inform decision-making across all regions and sectors.", "## Case Story 6.5: Assessing The Costs And Benefits Of Adaptation Options For Coastal Areas In Quebec And Atlantic Canada": "Canada's eastern and Atlantic coastal communities face growing risks from erosion and flooding due to climate change. To assess the value of adaptation measures, a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was conducted at 11 sites in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, encompassing 46 smaller coastal segments. The CBA compared the costs and benefits of adopting adaptation actions (\"with project\") to the costs of inaction (\"without project\"), including damage from flooding and erosion. Adaptation options included hard engineering structures, soft engineering interventions, and preventative measures. \n\nThe results suggest that implementing the best adaptation action for each site would yield net economic gains in 59% of cases, with preventative options often outperforming engineering measures. The decision to adapt and the choice of adaptation measures depend on site-specific factors, emphasizing the need for tailored solutions. The CBA provides a valuable tool to inform investment decisions and highlight the potential benefits of proactive adaptation to mitigate climate change impacts on vulnerable coastal areas.", "## Case Story 6.6: Considering Co-Benefits In The Economic Appraisal Of Adaptation Actions For Water Retention At Pelly'S Lake, Manitoba": "Pelly's Lake, a natural retention basin in Manitoba, is a vital water source for irrigation, supporting farmers facing variable precipitation due to climate change. An economic assessment by the University of Saskatchewan analyzed the impact of adaptation actions involving the lake on reducing water stress for crops. The results suggested that while irrigation increased crop yields, the additional gross income did not offset the investment and maintenance costs of the irrigation system. However, the water retention system at Pelly's Lake offers multiple co-benefits, including biomass production, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration, and flood risk reduction. These co-benefits, when monetized, could make a compelling business case for farmers to invest in irrigation and provide significant economic and environmental benefits to the region. \n\n- The retention basin has a water storage capacity of 2.1 million m3, making it a crucial source for irrigation.\n- The University of Saskatchewan's economic model projected increased crop yields and gross income with irrigation under different emissions scenarios.\n- However, when considering the costs of the irrigation system, the difference in gross margins was negative.\n- The water retention system provides valuable co-benefits, such as biomass production, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration, and flood risk reduction, valued at about $25,505 per hectare per year.\n- While the system does not pass a standard cost-benefit test for irrigation alone, the inclusion of the co-benefits makes it economically viable as a climate change adaptation measure.", "## 6.7.1.2 Cost Of Adaptation": "- Understanding the costs of climate change adaptation in Canada is a nascent field, with only a couple of recent studies providing insights. \n- The Insurance Bureau of Canada and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimate that, on average, $5.3 billion per year (in 2019 dollars) needs to be invested over a 50-year period to adapt Canadian public infrastructure to climate hazards. This equates to roughly 0.26% of the country's annual GDP. \n- Regionally, Atlantic Canada accounts for the majority of these planned expenditures, with $3.6 billion, or about two-thirds of the national total. \n- However, these estimates may be conservative, as they are based on a sample that may underrepresent certain regions and infrastructure types, and because the adaptation actions costed in community plans likely focus on the most critical climate risks.\n- A separate study estimates that adapting municipal infrastructure in Quebec for climate-related risks will cost between $2.8 and $5.4 billion over five years (in 2019 dollars), equivalent to 0.12\u20130.23% of GDP annually. Again, this may be an underestimate as it only considers a subset of public infrastructure.\n- Overall, while there is a lack of comprehensive data, it is clear that significant investment is required to adapt Canadian infrastructure to the challenges posed by climate change.", "## 6.7.2 The Economic Case For Adaptation": "The economic case for climate change adaptation in Canada is strong, with a wide range of adaptation actions offering benefits that outweigh the costs.

The average BCR across all actions is high at 5.6, but this is skewed by extremely high-value outliers; the median BCR is a more modest but still positive 1.5. \"Soft\" actions, such as planned retreat and enhanced pest control, offer the highest economic returns, with a mean BCR of over 10:1, compared to around 3:1 for \"hard engineering\" actions like dykes and sea walls. This is partly due to the higher upfront costs of hard engineering solutions but also to the inclusion of monetized co-benefits and indirect benefits in some soft action appraisals. While economic performance is a key criterion, other factors, such as risk reduction, must also be considered when selecting adaptation options. Overall, the analysis suggests that investing in climate change adaptation is a sound economic decision, with the potential to generate significant benefits for Canada.", "## 6.7.3 Residual Damages": "The NRTEE's studies reveal that despite adaptation efforts, the costs of climate change impacts on timber supply result in significant economic losses, with residual damages persisting. The total costs, including adaptation actions and residual losses, range from $6.9 billion to $40.7 billion. A comparison with other studies in Appendices 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 indicates that residual damage costs are a common occurrence, suggesting inherent limitations to the effectiveness of adaptation measures. While it is important to strive for effective adaptation, the presence of residual costs does not imply inadequate actions or insufficient adaptation but rather the potential infeasibility of completely eliminating damages or the high costs of doing so relative to the benefits. \n\n- The economic costs of climate change on timber supply are significant, with adaptation measures reducing but not eliminating losses. \n- Total costs, including adaptation and residual damages, are substantial, ranging from billions to tens of billions of dollars. \n- Residual costs are a common occurrence across studies, indicating potential limits to adaptation's effectiveness. \n- Aiming for zero residual damages may not be feasible or cost-effective.", "## 6.8 There Are Economic Barriers And Limits To Adaptation": "Here is a summary of the key points from the climate change report section: \n\n- There are numerous barriers to adapting to climate change, including ecological, technological, economic, and institutional factors, which limit the ability to reduce negative impacts and exploit new opportunities. \n\n- While government intervention can address these barriers and incentivize adaptation, there are limits to what can be achieved economically. \n\n- The \"adaptation gap\" refers to the discrepancy between the required level of adaptation to offset all negative climate change impacts and the current level of adaptation, made more challenging by ecological and technological constraints. \n\n- Some adaptation actions and policies may not be economically viable or feasible with available resources, resulting in residual damages and consequences that cannot be entirely avoided. \n\n- Therefore, an economically efficient adaptation strategy must accept that some negative impacts of climate change will persist, even with government intervention, and focus on minimizing these impacts as best as possible.", "## 6.8.1 Introduction": "Here is a summary of the key points from the climate change report section: \n\n- Adaptation has its limits and cannot offset all the negative impacts of climate change, and some positive impacts may also be beyond our reach. \n- The report identifies instances where adaptation efforts may fall short or be ineffective, such as in the case of extreme weather events in Canada, where an \"adaptation deficit\" currently exists. \n- This section of the report focuses on the economic barriers and limits to adaptation, defining a barrier as a challenge or constraint that can be overcome with effort, and a limit as a constraint that would require unreasonable costs or actions to surpass. \n- These barriers and limits can impede the ability of businesses and households to adapt to climate change and must be addressed to ensure effective and equitable adaptation measures are implemented. \n\nThe report underscores the complexity of adapting to climate change and highlights the need to understand and address the economic obstacles that may hinder our ability to adapt successfully.", "## 6.8.2 Barriers And Limits To Adaptation From An Economic Perspective": "The economic perspective on climate change adaptation highlights the role of private actors, including businesses and households, in undertaking autonomous adaptation to maximize their profits and welfare. While individuals and firms may adjust their behaviors in response to climate stimuli, evidence suggests that these adaptations are not always effective or optimal due to various barriers and limits, including technological, ecological, economic, and institutional constraints. As a result, there may be a gap between the required level of adaptation to mitigate negative impacts and the maximum potential for adaptation, resulting in \"unavoidable impacts.\" However, not all solutions for addressing these impacts will be economically viable, as the lifecycle costs of some adaptations may outweigh the economic benefits, indicating the need for alternative investments or strategies. This section emphasizes the complex interplay between private sector actions and the broader economic, ecological, and technological landscape in the context of climate change adaptation.", "## 6.8.2.1 Market Failures": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- The adoption of adaptation actions is complex and not solely determined by cost-benefit analyses. \n- Information asymmetry, externalities, public goods, and misaligned incentives can all impact the decision-making process and lead to underinvestment or inefficient allocation of resources for adaptation measures. \n- Market failures can result in decision-makers not having access to complete or accurate information about the costs and benefits of adaptation actions, further complicating the process. \n- The benefits of adaptation may not always accrue to those bearing the costs, creating a disconnect between those who pay and those who gain. \n- A range of barriers, as outlined by Klein et al. (2014), can further hinder the ability of individuals and businesses to invest in welfare-improving adaptation actions. \n\nOverall, the text highlights the multifaceted nature of adaptation decision-making and the potential disconnect between theoretical cost-benefit analyses and real-world adoption of adaptation measures. A variety of economic, informational, and incentive-based factors come into play, influencing the ultimate investment in and implementation of climate change adaptation actions.", "## Box 6.2: Market Failures And Adaptation": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- Market failures can result in an inefficient allocation of resources, leading to less effective and costly climate change adaptation strategies in Canada. \n- Moser and Ekstrom (2010) identify several factors that contribute to market mechanism failures, which can result in missed opportunities and higher costs. \n- These failures can manifest in various ways, such as inefficient resource allocation, which may hinder Canada's ability to adapt to climate change effectively and efficiently. \n\nThe potential consequences of market failures in the context of adaptation are important to consider for policymakers and stakeholders alike to ensure a robust and cost-effective response to climate change.", "## Information Failures": "- Private actors often face challenges when making decisions about climate change adaptation due to imperfect information. They may not fully understand the risks, adaptation options, or associated costs and benefits, leading to inefficient choices.\n\n- Information asymmetry can also occur, where some individuals have superior knowledge, potentially leading to opportunistic behavior. For example, a homeowner may expect others to bear the responsibility for climate impacts, and therefore underinvest in adaptation measures.\n\n- Misaligned incentives can be a problem in situations like property management, where the costs and benefits of adaptation are distributed unevenly between different parties. This could result in a lack of incentive for certain actors to invest in adaptation measures, such as a property owner who has little motivation to improve water efficiency if tenants pay the water bills. \n\nOverall, these issues can create barriers to effective climate change adaptation and highlight the need for improved information dissemination, incentive structures, and collaboration between different stakeholders.", "## Public Goods": "- Markets often struggle to provide public goods due to the \"free-rider\" issue, where individuals can benefit without contributing. \n- Adaptation public goods include community flood protection, climate data, and emergency preparedness\u2014goods that are challenging for private markets to profit from due to the presence of nonpayers who also benefit. \n- Markets may also not exist for certain climate-affected goods and services, like ecosystems, leading to a lack of market-driven resource allocation for adaptation. \n- As a result, these goods and services may be underprovided or entirely absent, creating a need for alternative mechanisms to ensure their provision. \n\nOverall, the report highlights the limitations of relying solely on private markets for adaptation measures, particularly when it comes to public goods and services that are essential for building climate resilience in Canada.", "## Externalities": "- Externalities are a key concept when discussing climate change and adaptation strategies, as they capture the unintended consequences of individual actions on society as a whole. \n\n- As temperatures rise, the increased use of air conditioning can lead to a cascade of externalities, including higher GHG emissions and air pollution, ultimately impacting the health and welfare of those who do not benefit from the cooling. \n\n- These external costs are often shouldered by society, rather than those taking the adaptive action, and highlight the complex interplay between individual choices and collective impacts in the face of climate change. \n\n- Understanding and addressing these externalities is crucial for equitable and effective climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.", "## 6.8.2.2 Behavioural Failures": "Canada's climate change report highlights how private actors, despite receiving signals from markets, can exhibit behavioural anomalies and biases that lead to seemingly irrational choices. These choices deviate from classical economic predictions, indicating behavioural failures. The report identifies several factors influencing decision-making, including information type, complexity, and volume, as well as communication methods. One notable factor is cognitive capacity, which affects our ability to process complex, probabilistic information needed for efficient adaptation decisions. Other behavioural issues, such as decision inertia and procrastination, further contribute to suboptimal choices. Understanding these behavioural dimensions is crucial for designing effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring that private actors can make informed, rational decisions that benefit both themselves and society as a whole.", "## 6.8.2.3 Policy Failures": "- Policy failures can create barriers to economically efficient adaptation to climate change. \n- Market distortions caused by certain regulations can lead to private actors misinvesting in adaptation measures. \n- Government incentives for flood protection and disaster aid in vulnerable coastal areas, for example, may encourage continued development despite the potential welfare gains from managed retreat. \n- Taxes and conflicting policy objectives can also contribute to policy failures, underscoring the need for careful policy design and clear objectives to support effective climate change adaptation. \n\nOverall, this section emphasizes the critical role of policy in shaping adaptation choices and the potential pitfalls that can arise when policy interventions distort market signals or pursue conflicting objectives.", "## 6.8.3 Role For Governments": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- The economic potential for climate change adaptation is often hindered by market, behavioral, and policy failures, necessitating government intervention. \n- The role of the government is multifaceted and includes removing impediments to private adaptation, using regulatory and economic tools to encourage efficient private adaptation, and providing public goods and services dedicated to adaptation.\n- When intervening, the government should consider the cost-benefit ratio, ensuring that the benefits of interventions exceed the costs. \n- Despite best efforts, some residual damages may be unavoidable due to financial and capacity constraints, leading to ethical and social justice issues that need to be addressed, particularly regarding vulnerable communities and defining acceptable levels of residual damage. \n- The government may need to aid vulnerable groups and communities who lack the resources to adapt, balancing this with other competing needs and constraints. \n\nThis section of the report highlights the complex role of the government in ensuring economically efficient and socially just adaptation to climate change in Canada.", "## 6.9 Moving Forward": "Canada is witnessing a growing demand from decision-makers for robust evidence on the economic impacts of climate change and the potential gains from adaptation strategies. This demand underscores the critical importance of economic considerations in shaping climate change responses. \n\n- The volume and quality of evidence on climate change costs and adaptation benefits are improving, providing a valuable resource for informed decision-making. \n\n- However, knowledge gaps remain, highlighting the need for further research to support effective policy formulation and implementation. \n\n- Filling these gaps can strengthen the business case for climate action and ensure that adaptation strategies are underpinned by robust economic justifications. \n\nThis evolving landscape of evidence and its application in policy and practice is crucial for building a resilient and sustainable future for Canada in the face of climate change.", "## 6.9.1 Costs Of Inaction": "Canada's understanding of the economic impacts of climate change remains uncertain, with a need for further research to guide adaptation decisions, particularly at the local and provincial levels.

Any persistent disruption to this balance leads to climate change. These disruptions are called \"climate drivers\" and their effect is measured through \"radiative forcing,\" which calculates the net change in the Earth's energy system. Positive radiative forcing, caused by factors like greenhouse gases and solar irradiance, leads to a warmer climate by trapping excess energy. Negative radiative forcing, on the other hand, results in a cooler climate as more energy escapes the atmosphere. \n\nClimate drivers can be natural, such as volcanic eruptions, or anthropogenic, such as human-induced changes to atmospheric composition and the land surface. The influence of these drivers on the Earth's energy balance can be ranked using radiative forcing measurements, expressed in watts per square meter (W/m2). Understanding these climate drivers and their historical context, dating back to the 19th century, is crucial for comprehending the foundations of climate change and has been a consistent theme in IPCC assessments.", "## Box 2.1: The Greenhouse Effect And Drivers Of Climate Change": "The Earth's climate system is primarily driven by energy from the sun, with the balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation determining our planet's average temperature. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere create a natural greenhouse effect, raising Earth's temperature and making it habitable. This balance, however, can be disrupted by climate drivers or forcing agents, which can be natural or human-induced. These drivers influence the climate by altering incoming solar radiation, the Earth's albedo or reflectivity, and the composition of the atmosphere, thereby changing the amount of outgoing infrared radiation. \n\n- Incoming solar radiation can be affected by fluctuations in solar output.\n- The Earth's albedo can be altered by changes in atmospheric aerosols, clouds, and land and ice cover.\n- Atmospheric GHG concentrations impact the emission of infrared radiation, with higher concentrations trapping more heat.\n\nThese interactions between solar radiation, the Earth's surface, and the atmosphere are key to understanding climate change and its drivers.", "# Greenhouse Effect": "Solar irradiance, volcanic activity, and Earth's albedo are natural factors that influence climate change. Small fluctuations in solar radiation over an 11-year cycle can cause temperature variations of up to 0.1\u00baC. Volcanic eruptions release gases and dust, forming sulfate aerosols that reflect solar radiation and cause temporary cooling. \n\nHuman activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, release pollutants and GHGs, affecting Earth's albedo and atmospheric composition. These aerosols and clouds interact to reflect or absorb solar radiation, driving climate change. Land surface alterations, such as deforestation, also increase Earth's reflectivity. \n\nThe key driver of heat retention in the Earth's atmosphere is the chemical composition of the atmosphere, particularly the presence of GHGs. These gases, including water vapor, CO2, methane, ozone, N2O, and halocarbons, trap heat and create a positive radiative forcing effect, leading to a warming climate. The accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere has reduced heat loss, contributing to the observed warming of the planet.", "## Box 2.2: Sources Of The Main Greenhouse Gases": "The buildup of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in our atmosphere is primarily due to human activity, which emits these gases faster than natural processes can remove them. While most GHGs have natural sources, human-made sources are a significant contributor, especially halocarbons, which are entirely anthropogenic. This imbalance between emissions and natural removal processes leads to a concerning accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere, driving climate change. \n\n- The key takeaway is that human activity is responsible for the excess emissions of GHGs, including those from natural sources, due to the rate at which they are released. \n- Halocarbons, a human-made group of GHGs, are a unique contributor as they have no natural sources.", "## Carbon Dioxide": "- Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are key components of the Earth's natural carbon cycle, which includes the atmosphere, land, ocean, and living organisms.\n- Natural processes that release CO2 include plant and animal respiration, while photosynthesis and ocean uptake remove it from the atmosphere.\n- Human activities, however, have significantly increased CO2 emissions through the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and land clearing. These practices release CO2 immediately or allow vegetation to decay slowly, emitting CO2 over time.\n- An additional source of CO2 emissions is the manufacturing of cement, which involves a process that releases CO2 when heating limestone (calcium carbonate).\n- Overall, human activities have disrupted the natural carbon cycle, leading to an accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and contributing to climate change.", "## Methane": "Here is a summary of the key points from the climate change report section on CH4:\n\n- Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, primarily arises from the decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms in low-oxygen environments, with wetlands being the most significant natural source.\n- Human activities contribute to methane emissions from various sources, including rice paddies, landfills, sewage, ruminant animal digestion, and artificial wetlands.\n- Incomplete combustion during the burning of fossil fuels and trees, as well as leaks and venting during fossil fuel extraction, processing, and transportation, are additional sources of methane release into the atmosphere.\n- Geological sources, such as natural leaks, also contribute to methane emissions.\n- Overall, methane emissions contribute significantly to climate change, and understanding and mitigating these sources is crucial for addressing this global challenge.", "## Nitrous Oxide": "- Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and air pollutant that plays a significant role in Earth's nitrogen cycle. \n- Human activities, particularly agricultural practices, have led to an increase in N2O concentrations in the atmosphere. \n- The use of synthetic fertilizers and manure to enhance crop growth, as well as the cultivation of certain nitrogen-fixing crops, have been the primary anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions. \n- Fossil fuel combustion and some industrial processes also contribute to N2O releases. \n- These activities have added reactive nitrogen to ecosystems, which is then converted into N2O, impacting the environment and contributing to climate change. \n\nOverall, human activities, especially agricultural practices and fossil fuel usage, have significantly contributed to the increase in N2O emissions, with potential environmental and climatic consequences.", "## Halocarbons": "Halocarbons are a diverse group of synthetic chemicals, featuring a combination of halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine) and carbon.

Important positive feedbacks include the water vapor feedback and the snow/ice albedo feedback, which have contributed to warming over the Industrial Era. \n- The overall feedback response of the climate system is positive, leading to amplified global warming. \n- As climate change progresses, certain feedbacks will become more significant, including those related to the carbon cycle and permafrost thaw, which could lead to additional GHG emissions. \n\nOverall, this section emphasizes the role of climate feedbacks, particularly positive feedback loops, in amplifying the impacts of human-induced climate change and highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the climate system.", "## Box 2.3: Positive Feedbacks That Amplify Climate Change The Water Vapour Feedback": "Water vapour is a powerful greenhouse gas, absorbing heat radiation from the Earth. While human activity does not directly influence water vapour levels, it is controlled by atmospheric temperature. Warmer air can hold more moisture, and with each degree Celsius increase, the atmosphere's water vapour capacity rises by about 7%. This creates a positive feedback loop where initial warming from human-caused increases in greenhouse gases like CO2 leads to more water vapour, which amplifies the warming effect. This feedback mechanism is a significant contributor to climate change, as described by Boucher et al. in 2013. Thus, while water vapour is a natural part of the Earth's atmosphere, its role in the greenhouse effect and climate change is substantial and often underappreciated.", "## The Snow/Ice Albedo Feedback": "The Earth's climate is influenced by the reflective properties of snow and ice, which have a high albedo, or reflectivity. When snow and ice melt, they expose darker land and water surfaces that absorb more solar radiation, contributing to climate warming. This is known as the snow/ice albedo feedback and has led to Arctic temperatures warming at approximately double the rate of the rest of the planet. The initial warming caused by declining sea ice and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere triggers further melting, creating a positive climate feedback loop. This feedback mechanism, in combination with other climate drivers, such as greenhouse gases (GHGs), has significant implications for the planet's climate system. The relationship between GHGs and climate warming is well established, with the IPCC's first assessment in 1990 concluding that human activities substantially increase GHG concentrations, enhancing the greenhouse effect and leading to additional warming.", "## 2.3.2: Changes In Greenhouse Gases And Radiative Forcing Over The Industrial Era": "The Industrial Era, a period of intense fossil fuel usage, has significantly altered Earth's atmosphere. Here is a summary of the key points: \n\n- The Industrial Era, marked by fossil fuel combustion, has led to a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2 and other trace gas concentrations, notably greenhouse gases (GHGs).\n- This era, commencing in the mid-18th century, is identified as the turning point when human activity began to noticeably impact the planet's climate.\n- Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants, leading to a rapid increase in industrial activity and significant environmental consequences. \n- The chemical composition of the atmosphere has been altered, with potential long-term effects on global climate patterns. \n\nThis section of the report highlights the significant impact of human activity, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels, on Earth's atmosphere and the potential consequences for global climate change.", "## 2.3.2.1: Changes In Greenhouse Gas Concentrations Over The Industrial Era": "The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) since the Industrial Era is predominantly due to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. This has led to a significant increase in CO2 concentrations, with roughly 555 Pg C emitted by human activities between 1750 and 2011. Natural processes act as sinks, removing GHGs from the atmosphere, but they have been outpaced by human emissions, leading to a net increase in atmospheric GHGs. Multiple lines of evidence, including carbon cycle records, geochemical data, and measurements of atmospheric composition, confirm this. The natural carbon cycle had been balanced for millennia, but human activities have disrupted this balance, leading to rising CO2 levels and subsequent ocean acidification. Well-mixed GHGs, which have long atmospheric lifetimes, are monitored globally, with Canada contributing data from several locations. These measurements show that human-induced emissions are causing a rise in atmospheric GHG concentrations, with global implications.", "## Box 2.4: Canadian Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Monitoring": "Canada has a comprehensive program for monitoring greenhouse gases (GHGs), with stations across the country measuring carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The data collected helps track global GHG trends and the impact of climate change on Canadian ecosystems. Northern Hemisphere GHG concentrations are slightly higher than the global average due to higher emissions in this hemisphere. \n\n- Canadian monitoring sites show clear seasonal cycles of CO2 concentration due to photosynthesis and respiration. \n- The vast Canadian boreal forest absorbs a significant amount of carbon, and this uptake has increased in warmer years. \n- Atmospheric observations of CH4 in the Arctic are crucial for detecting any rapid changes due to permafrost thaw. \n- Long-term records show substantial increases in GHG concentrations during the Industrial Era: CO2 up 40%, CH4 up 150%, and N2O up 20%. \n- These concentrations are the highest in at least 800,000 years, based on ice core data. \n\nIn summary, atmospheric observations are vital for understanding global GHG trends, evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, and studying the climate feedback loops of Canadian ecosystems.", "## Changes In Radiative Forcing Over The Industrial Era": "The report summarizes the key climate forcing agents and their effects on the Earth's energy balance over the Industrial Era (1750-2011). Well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily CO2, CH4, and N2O, have had the most significant warming impact, with CO2 alone accounting for two-thirds of the total forcing. Tropospheric ozone, formed from natural processes and air pollutant emissions, has also contributed to warming. Cooling effects have resulted from human activities, such as increasing aerosol levels and land surface changes, which reflect more sunlight back into space. The net effect of human activities is a warming force of 2.3 W/m2, with GHGs being the dominant factor. Natural forcing agents, like volcanic eruptions and solar irradiance changes, have had a much smaller impact, accounting for less than 10% of the total forcing changes. Overall, the positive radiative forcing has led to an energy uptake by the climate system, with the increase in CO2 concentration being the primary driver of global warming and climate change.", "## 2.3.3: Natural Climate Variability": "The detection of anthropogenic climate change signals can be challenging due to the inherently chaotic nature of our climate system, which is influenced by internal climate variability and natural external factors. This \"noise\" can obscure the identification of long-term trends and patterns. \n\n- Internal climate variability, like the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO), independently generates fluctuations within the climate system. \n- External natural forcings, such as volcanic eruptions, can also significantly impact the climate over short periods. \n- Together, these factors create a \"noisy\" backdrop, making it difficult to discern the human-induced climate change signal. \n- As a result, isolating and attributing climate change drivers require careful analysis and an understanding of these natural variations. \n\nIn summary, while the climate system is complex and subject to natural variability, the identification of human-induced signals is crucial for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.", "## Box 2.5: Modes Of Climate Variability": "Climate variability refers to distinct patterns of climate change with specific characteristics, impacting certain regions over defined periods.

The warming trend is likely to be between 0.6\u00baC and 0.8\u00baC, with a high likelihood that human influence caused more than half of this increase. This conclusion considers the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol forcing, with the latter contributing more uncertainty due to complex factors. Volcanic aerosols and solar variations played a minor role, and natural internal variability had a small impact on the observed trends. The warming observed in the early 20th century is unlikely to be solely attributed to internal variability, indicating a significant human influence on long-term climate change.

Short Answer": "Canada is experiencing a unique response to climate change, with local conditions amplifying the effects of increasing greenhouse gases. A key factor is the loss of snow and sea ice, which reduces reflectivity and allows more solar radiation to be absorbed, resulting in faster warming than in other regions. This phenomenon, known as albedo effect, is more pronounced in the Canadian Arctic, which is warming at about three times the global rate. Canada as a whole is also warming at a faster rate than the world average, at more than double the pace. These variations in warming rates are due to local climate processes and feedback loops, showcasing the complex and dynamic nature of climate change.", "## Long Answer": "Canada is experiencing a unique and enhanced rate of surface warming, more than double the global average, with the Canadian Arctic warming at triple the global rate. This phenomenon, known as \"Arctic amplification,\" is driven by a combination of five key climate feedback loops: lapse-rate, snow/ice albedo, Planck, cloud, and water vapor feedback. These feedback mechanisms interact with the increased greenhouse gas concentrations, causing higher rates of warming in certain regions, especially high-latitude areas like the Canadian Arctic. \n\nClimate models play a crucial role in understanding and projecting future climate change.

The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report reveals that the warming induced by CO2 is directly proportional to the total amount of cumulative CO2 emissions. This relationship holds across various climate models and emission pathways. As a result, we can estimate the maximum CO2 emissions allowed to stay within a certain temperature threshold. For instance, limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C, as agreed in the Paris Agreement, requires staying below a specific level of cumulative CO2 emissions with a certain likelihood. The IPCC assessed that for a 50% chance of keeping warming below 2\u00b0C, CO2 emissions from 2011 onwards must not exceed 1300 billion tonnes of CO2.

This is true whether emissions cease in the present or future. Other climate aspects, like vegetation and sea levels, will continue to change. The temperature response to stopping other long-lived greenhouse gas emissions is similar and takes a long time to reduce. Ceasing aerosol emissions causes rapid warming, while stopping short-lived GHG emissions leads to cooling. These findings highlight the complex and long-term impacts of emissions on the Earth's climate system. \n\n- Earth system models project that global temperatures remain stable for centuries after CO2 emissions cessation.\n- Other climate variables, such as vegetation and sea levels, will continue to change.\n- Stopping aerosol emissions causes rapid warming, while discontinuing short-lived GHG emissions leads to cooling.\n- The temperature response to other long-lived GHGs is similar to CO2, taking a very long time to decrease.", "## Box 3.3: Short-Lived Climate Forcers": "Climate forcers, or climate forcing agents, directly impact the climate and can be natural or human-induced. These agents are categorized by their atmospheric lifespan, with long-lived substances, like carbon dioxide (CO2), remaining in the atmosphere for centuries, and short-lived ones, such as methane and black carbon, persisting for days to decades. Reducing emissions of short-lived climate forcers quickly lowers their atmospheric concentration and improves air quality. These short-lived agents are crucial in climate policy discussions as mitigating their warming effects can slow temperature rise and improve human health. \n\nThe complexity of CO2 means a single lifetime value doesn't apply, but a significant portion will remain in the atmosphere for over a millennium, continuing to influence global warming.

Two main downscaling methods exist: statistical and dynamical. Statistical downscaling combines climate model projections with local or regional observations to provide more detailed climate information, correcting systematic model biases. Dynamical downscaling, on the other hand, utilizes regional climate models that operate at high resolution over limited areas, driven by output from global climate models. Regional models offer the advantage of simulating climate at a much higher resolution, capturing small-scale features and providing valuable input for impact models. However, it is still a subject of research to determine the conditions under which regional models provide added value compared to global models.

This data is now being used to map and understand groundwater variability in major Canadian water basins:\n\n- Natural Resources Canada is utilizing GRACE data and other measurements to map groundwater variability over time, offering a comprehensive national view.\n- The focus is on four key regions: the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, Alberta, the Eastern Rocky Mountains, and Canada as a whole.\n- These maps provide a new perspective on groundwater, helping to quantify recent changes in storage and offering insights into the country's water resources.\n- The GRACE mission's continuation ensures that this vital data source remains available, aiding in the management and understanding of Canada's water resources and the impact of climate change.", "## Groundwater Storage Changes Within The Laurentian Great Lakes Basin": "Here is a summary of the provided section of the climate change report: \n\n- The report focuses on groundwater storage (GWS) changes in Canada's Laurentian Great Lakes Basin between 2002 and 2010, utilizing GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) models and auxiliary data. \n\n- During this period, average GWS losses were estimated at 5.0 km\u00b3/year, equivalent to a 6.5 mm groundwater loss annually when spread over all land areas of the basin. \n\n- The data reveals distinct annual cycles, with a peak-to-peak magnitude of approximately 50 mm in water thickness equivalent. \n\n- However, the report also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting these trends due to the relatively short analysis period and uncertainties in soil moisture change models. \n\n- To fully understand long-term GWS changes in the basin, the report concludes that further GRACE observations and continued monitoring are necessary. \n\nOverall, this section of the report provides valuable insights into groundwater storage fluctuations in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin, highlighting the importance of continued surveillance and the potential impact of climate change on water resources.", "## Mapping Groundwater Storage Variations In Alberta": "Groundwater storage and recharge dynamics are complex and vary across Canada. From 2002 to 2014, Alberta saw an average increase of 11 mm per year in groundwater storage, with positive trends moving from west to east. Groundwater recharge occurs through various means, including infiltration of precipitation and snowmelt, and rates differ based on regional climate and aquifer characteristics. Recharge rates in Canada are typically 65% or less of annual precipitation and are challenging to quantify on a large scale. Regional differences exist, with eastern Canada having higher recharge rates compared to the Prairie region and British Columbia. \n\nGroundwater level trends are mixed, with approximately 80% of wells across Western Canada exhibiting significant variations. Some regional studies have linked changes in groundwater levels to long-term variations in precipitation and snowmelt, particularly in shallower aquifers. Climate change is expected to impact future groundwater recharge, but the direction and magnitude of these changes are highly uncertain due to the complexity of the systems and the lack of consistent data. However, there is medium confidence that spring recharge of groundwater aquifers across most of Canada will occur earlier due to projected earlier snowmelt.", "## Acknowledgments": "The report, *Changes in Oceans Surrounding Canada*, offers an insightful analysis of Canada's marine climate change. Here are the key takeaways: \n\n- The document is authored by a team of experts from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, led by B.J.W. Greenan, and published in 2019 as a chapter in *Canada's Changing Climate Report*. \n- It covers the impact of climate change on Canadian oceans, including the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans, with a focus on the period from 1970 to 2018. \n- Key findings include the increase in ocean temperatures, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification, all of which have significant ecological, economic, and social implications for Canada's coastal regions. \n- The report also highlights the vulnerability of marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and fish populations, to these changes, and the potential consequences for the fisheries industry and coastal communities. \n- Finally, the document emphasizes the urgency of adapting to and mitigating these impacts to ensure the sustainability and resilience of Canada's marine environments and the well-being of dependent communities. \n\nThis comprehensive report provides valuable insights into the far-reaching effects of climate change on Canada's oceans and the need for proactive measures to address these challenges.", "## Chapter Key Messages 7.2: Ocean Temperature": "- Oceans surrounding Canada are feeling the effects of anthropogenic climate change, with notable warming over the last century. \n- The upper ocean temperatures in the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic have increased, and the Canadian Arctic ocean in summer and fall has also warmed due to rising air temperatures and melting sea ice. \n- Projections for the 21st century indicate continued warming, with the greatest increases in ice-free Arctic regions and southern Atlantic Canada, where subtropical waters will creep northward. \n- In the coming decades, the pattern of ocean warming will vary seasonally: during winters, the Atlantic Canada ocean will warm the most, while the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions will experience the least warming. \n- These changes have significant implications for marine ecosystems, coastal communities, and the overall climate system in and around Canada.", "## 7.3: Ocean Salinity And Density Stratification": "- Climate change is causing significant alterations to the salinity of Canada's ocean waters, with important implications for the environment and climate regulation. \n- A long-term trend of decreasing salinity, or freshening, has been observed in the upper ocean waters off the Canadian coast, influenced by both human-induced climate change and natural decadal variations. \n- This freshening is projected to persist and intensify in most areas over the coming decades due to rising precipitation and melting ice, with potential impacts on ocean circulation and ecosystems. \n- However, there is a notable exception: the waters south of Atlantic Canada are expected to become saltier due to the northward shift of subtropical currents, highlighting regional variations in climate impacts. \n- These changes in salinity, along with warming temperatures, will increase the vertical stratification of water density, affecting the ocean's ability to absorb greenhouse gases, altering dissolved oxygen levels, and impacting marine life.", "## 7.4: Marine Winds, Storms, And Waves": "- Climate change is causing significant changes to wave activity in Canadian waters, with implications for coastal communities and ecosystems. \n- The Canadian Arctic has seen an increase in wave heights and a longer wave season since 1970, and this trend is expected to continue as sea ice melts. \n- Off the east coast, as seasonal ice disappears, wave activity is also expected to increase, while a slight northward shift in storm tracks may lead to decreased wind speeds and lower wave heights in the Atlantic region. \n- On the Pacific coast, there are contrasting trends, with waves growing taller in winter but shrinking in summer, presenting challenges for coastal management and marine safety. \n- These changes underscore the dynamic nature of Canada's marine environment and highlight the need for adaptive strategies to safeguard vulnerable coastal areas.", "## 7.5: Sea Level": "- Global sea levels are rising and expected to continue doing so, with projections for the 21st century ranging from tens of centimetres to potentially over one metre.\n- In Canada, local variations will depend on vertical land motion, with relative sea-level rise or fall having distinct regional impacts. \n- Atlantic Canada is particularly vulnerable, with land subsidence exacerbating relative sea-level rise, increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme water-level events, and subsequent flooding, infrastructure damage, and coastal erosion. \n- The interplay between declining sea ice cover, increased wave action, and larger storm surges will further amplify extreme high water-level events, especially along the Arctic and Atlantic coasts. \n- Adaptation strategies must consider local projections and the unique challenges posed by relative sea-level changes to effectively safeguard communities and ecosystems.", "## 7.6: Ocean Chemistry": "- The oceans surrounding Canada are experiencing significant changes due to increasing carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere. One of the most notable effects is the increasing acidity of the water, particularly in the Arctic Ocean, which is expected to continue acidifying at an accelerated rate. \n- Ocean waters off the Canadian coast are showing signs of decreasing oxygen concentrations, particularly in the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic. This is attributed to rising temperatures and density stratification caused by anthropogenic climate change. \n- Climate change is also influencing nutrient supply to the ocean surface layer, with a general decrease observed in the North Pacific due to increasing stratification. \n- These changes in ocean chemistry and nutrient availability have significant implications for marine life, with low oxygen conditions expected to become more widespread and detrimental. \n- Overall, these observations highlight the substantial impact of climate change on the ocean environment surrounding Canada, underscoring the urgent need for mitigation and adaptation strategies to preserve marine ecosystems.", "## 7.1: Introduction": "The global ocean, an interconnected system, plays a crucial role in Earth's climate system. Absorbing over 90% of the excess heat energy between 1971 and 2010, the ocean's heat content rise is a stark indicator of global warming. With a vast coastline bordering the Arctic, Canada's oceans have unique features, from narrow coastal zones to deep basins. Regional variations are influenced by powerful currents like the North Pacific and Gulf Stream, creating diverse marine ecosystems. The ocean also absorbs CO2, leading to increased acidification, and acts as a reservoir for glacial meltwater, contributing to sea-level rise. Pacific water entering the Arctic through the Beaufort Gyre and outflow through the Canadian Arctic impact Canada's coastal regions, with the Labrador and Gulf Streams influencing temperature and salinity gradients. These complex ocean dynamics have far-reaching consequences for Canada's climate and ecosystems.", "## Box 7.1: Assessment Of Canada'S Marine Coasts": "Canada's vast and varied coastline is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, as outlined in the scientific assessment, *Canada's Marine Coasts in a Changing Climate*.

The report highlights the importance of large-scale ocean currents and gyres, formed primarily by wind and seawater properties, which transport heat, carbon, and other elements globally. The Labrador Sea, through deep convection, sinks dense water to intermediate depths, contributing to the \"global conveyor belt\" of the meridional overturning circulation. This process regulates Earth's climate by moving heat and carbon between the upper and deep ocean. Climate change impacts, such as surface warming and freshening, are expected to reduce convection depths, affecting carbon sequestration and the strength of Atlantic currents. The Arctic, with its rapid air temperature rise and sea ice decline, provides early signs of anthropogenic climate change. The complex coastline and seabed topography of Canada's coastal zones challenge climate variability detection and projection. Long-term coastal observation sites, however, offer insights into both offshore and neighboring coastal waters. Overall, the ocean surrounding Canada is a key component of the Earth's climate system, and its changes have significant implications for global climate regulation and local ecosystems.", "## 7.2: Ocean Temperature Key Message": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- Oceans surrounding Canada have experienced warming trends over the past century due to anthropogenic climate change, with the Canadian Arctic being particularly affected during summer and fall.\n- Projections indicate that these warming trends will continue throughout the 21st century, with varying rates of change across different regions. Summer warming will be most pronounced in ice-free Arctic regions and off southern Atlantic Canada.\n- The ocean plays a crucial role in absorbing radiation from the sun and greenhouse gases, storing this heat energy in its upper layers. Water's high heat capacity means that the ocean can absorb a significant amount of heat with only small temperature increases.\n- While the vertical extent of warming in the ocean is less than that of the lower atmosphere, the ocean has absorbed over 90% of the Earth's excess heat since 1955. This highlights the critical role the ocean plays in mitigating climate change. \n- Natural climate variability, such as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, also influences regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs), causing short-term and multi-decadal variations.", "## 7.2.1: Observations": "Canada has been monitoring ocean temperatures for over a century, but consistent Arctic Ocean observations are scarce, often limited to specific locations and the last few decades. The country's ocean temperature data has evolved from ship-based sampling to more advanced methods like satellite surveillance for surface waters and Argo floats for the deep ocean. The report focuses on long-term data collected by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), including site-specific time series representative of broader shelf and open-ocean regions. \n\n- Ocean temperature observations are critical for understanding climate change, with a focus on the Arctic Ocean and Canada's surrounding waters. \n- The evolution of technology has improved data collection, but historical context from early-20th-century records provides a longer-term perspective on ocean temperature trends. \n- DFO's data offers insights into temperature changes in Canadian waters, with implications for broader oceanic regions. \n\nThis summary highlights the key points about Canada's ocean temperature monitoring efforts and the importance of these observations for climate change understanding.", "## 7.2.1.1: Northeast Pacific Ocean": "The Northeast Pacific's sea surface and upper-ocean temperatures are influenced by natural variations like ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Long-term monitoring programs by the DFO on Canada's west coast track ocean temperature changes. Data since 1914 from the British Columbia Shore Station Oceanographic Program and deep-ocean data since 1956 from the Line P program show warming trends. Temperatures at Amphitrite Point, Kains Island, and Entrance Island on Vancouver Island's coasts are rising by 0.08-0.15\u00b0C per decade. Similar trends are observed in the US Northwest and Alaska coastal regions. The DFO's Figure 7.3 illustrates annual mean temperature increases off British Columbia, with significant trends at the 1% level. These warming patterns have implications for the region's marine ecosystems and fisheries.", "## 7.2.1.2: Northwest Atlantic Ocean": "The Northwest Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Scotian Shelf, and Gulf of Maine, has exhibited long-term warming trends. In situ data reveal a correlation between surface and air temperature variations, with a notable warming trend in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The warming rate near the bottom is higher at 0.23\u00b0C per decade due to the influence of subtropical waters from the Gulf Stream. The Newfoundland Shelf and Labrador Sea have shown less significant warming trends, with some areas displaying no significant change over the past century. Comparisons between in situ measurements and global monthly interpolated SST datasets strengthen confidence in the observed temperature changes. The absence of a long-term warming trend in the Labrador Sea is consistent with the lack of net warming south of Greenland, attributed to natural climate variability and a potential weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Caution is advised when interpreting short-term observational records, as natural decadal-scale variability in these waters can be comparable to global anthropogenic climate change. Finally, Atlantic Canada has experienced earlier spring warming and limited changes in the timing of fall cooling, leading to potential extensions of summertime SST conditions.", "## 7.2.1.3: Arctic Ocean": "Despite data gaps, strong evidence indicates that the Canadian Arctic's climate has changed significantly over the last century.

Most Canadian offshore areas have experienced slight long-term freshening of upper-ocean waters, while salinity has increased below the surface in some mid-latitude regions. These changes are attributed to factors such as increased precipitation, melting ice, and freshwater runoff. Over the next century, these trends are projected to continue, with increasing precipitation and melting ice driving further freshening in most areas, and a northward shift of saltier subtropical water causing salinity increases south of Atlantic Canada. These changes will have significant impacts on ocean circulation, density stratification, and mixing, with potential consequences for greenhouse gas sequestration, dissolved oxygen levels, and marine ecosystems. The differences in sea surface salinity between evaporation-dominated and rainfall-dominated regions have become more pronounced since the 1950s, with potential far-reaching effects on the global ocean circulation and climate system.", "## Box 7.3: Brine Rejection": "Sea ice plays a crucial role in the Earth's climate system, and its formation and melt have significant impacts on ocean circulation and the environment. A key process during sea ice formation is brine rejection, where salt is expelled from the forming ice, making the sea ice fresher than the seawater below it. This brine rejection process creates a layer of freshwater on the ocean surface when the ice melts. This freshwater layer has important implications for the ocean's circulation, as it can act as a barrier, impacting the exchange of heat, carbon, and other nutrients between the ocean and the atmosphere. \n\n- Brine rejection during sea ice formation increases the salinity of the surrounding seawater, impacting ocean circulation.\n- Melting sea ice contributes to a freshwater layer on the ocean surface, influencing heat and nutrient exchange.\n- These processes have far-reaching effects on the climate and ecosystems, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of Earth's climate system. \n\nOverall, the brine rejection and melt processes of sea ice have wide-ranging impacts, contributing to the complex interplay between the ocean, climate, and the environment.", "## Box 7.4: Ocean Density Stratification": "- Ocean density stratification, caused by variations in temperature, salinity, and pressure, creates distinct layers of water with different densities. \n- Near-surface waters are typically warmer and less salty, while deeper waters are colder and denser. \n- This stratification is more pronounced in the upper ocean and varies seasonally, forming in spring and summer due to solar heating and freshwater inputs, then dissipating in fall. \n- Vertical mixing is restricted by stratification, particularly in the upper ocean during spring and summer.\n- The impact of this on the circulation of heat, carbon dioxide, and nutrients is significant. \n- With ongoing climate change, increased warming and freshwater runoff are expected to enhance stratification in Arctic and subpolar oceans, potentially reducing the ocean's capacity to absorb human-induced carbon dioxide and disrupting nutrient upwelling, which could have far-reaching consequences for marine ecosystems and global warming. \n\nOverall, the text highlights how ocean density stratification is influenced by climate change, and how these changes may have negative impacts on the ocean's ability to mitigate global warming and support marine life.", "## 7.3.1: Observations": "Ocean salinity, a crucial climate change indicator, has been monitored since the 19th century through research cruises. However, these observations are less frequent than temperature measurements due to the technical challenges of salinity measurement. Canada's continental shelf waters are monitored through vertical profiles by research vessels and moored instruments providing continuous time series data, offering a comprehensive view of salinity changes over time. This data is essential for understanding the complex interactions between ocean salinity, circulation, and climate variability, especially in the unique marine environments surrounding Canada's vast coastline. \n\n- Ocean salinity observations provide valuable insights into climate change.\n- Research cruises have measured salinity since the 19th century, but these measurements are less frequent than temperature readings.\n- Canada relies on research vessels and moored instruments to monitor salinity on its continental shelves.\n- The data helps scientists understand the relationship between salinity, ocean circulation, and climate patterns.", "## 7.3.1.1: Northeast Pacific Ocean": "Canada's Pacific Ocean waters have experienced slight but complex changes in salinity over the last few decades.

This is influenced by changes in both surface temperature and salinity. \n- Natural variability plays a significant role in decade-to-decade fluctuations, and some regions, like the western Gulf of St. Lawrence, have shown decreasing stratification due to changing freshwater discharges. \n\nThese findings provide important insights into the complex climate dynamics of the region and highlight the long-term changes occurring in Canada's Atlantic marine environment.", "## 7.3.1.3: Arctic Ocean": "- There are complex changes in freshwater and salinity levels across the Canadian Arctic, with no consistent pattern.\n- The Arctic Ocean's mixed layer is becoming fresher, but the southern Beaufort Sea stands out with a notable increase in salinity of 2 per decade from 1982-2012.\n- The Beaufort Gyre's circulation and the Mackenzie River's runoff influence the Beaufort Sea's salinity, making trend analysis challenging.\n- In contrast, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and parts of the Baffin Island Shelf show signs of freshening, particularly at deeper levels.\n- No significant long-term trends are observed in central Baffin Bay's salinity, indicating stability in this region.\n\nOverall, the report highlights the dynamic and varied nature of freshwater and salinity changes in the Canadian Arctic, with potential implications for circulation patterns and the region's delicate marine ecosystems.", "## 7.3.2: Future Projections": "- Climate models predict that sea surface salinity will change as the century progresses, with subtropical regions becoming more saline due to evaporation, and high-latitude regions, including the northeastern Pacific off Canada, experiencing significant freshening by mid-century.\n\n- These projections remain consistent under both medium and high emission scenarios, indicating the robustness of the predicted freshening in the region. \n\n- The CMIP5 model ensemble mean suggests a general freshening of the sea surface in the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic by mid-century, with a small standard deviation indicating agreement among models for the Northeast Pacific specifically. \n\n- However, there are larger discrepancies between model projections for the Arctic and Northwest Atlantic, where sea ice and complex ocean dynamics present simulation challenges.", "## Figure Source: Adapted From Loder And Van Der Baaren (2013).": "By the middle of the century, significant freshening is projected in the subpolar Northwest Atlantic under medium and high emission scenarios. This is contrasted by increased salinity in the subtropical gyre, accentuating the difference between the two gyres. The boundary between these trends sits around 40\u00ba north latitude. Climate models suggest that the CMIP5 projections may underestimate the expected changes in salinity for the Northwest Atlantic shelf. \n\nThe loss of sea ice and increased precipitation will impact freshwater input into the Arctic Ocean, with projections indicating a decrease in surface salinity in the Beaufort Sea and areas north of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The transport of freshwater tied to sea ice is expected to weaken and eventually disappear. \n\nOverall, there has been a slight long-term freshening of upper-ocean waters off Canada due to anthropogenic climate change and natural decadal variability.

In contrast, wave heights off the Pacific coast have displayed a seasonal contrast, with increases in winter and decreases in summer.\n\n- Marine storms, driven by wind and wave activity, can disrupt offshore economies and coastal communities. While changes in storm frequency and intensity may have adverse effects, uncertainty remains due to limited historical data and inconsistencies across research studies and climate models. \n\n- Attributing regional changes in storminess solely to anthropogenic climate change is challenging due to the dynamic and short-lived nature of storms, leading to lower confidence in projections related to atmospheric circulation compared to thermodynamic properties like temperature.", "## 7.4.1: Marine Winds And Storms": "Canada's ocean regions are witnessing notable changes in wind and storm patterns. Evidence suggests a northward shift of storm tracks, consistent with global trends, resulting in slightly reduced wind speeds and wave heights in Atlantic Canada. Autumn sees an increase in extreme storms, while other seasons show no significant changes.

This rise in sea levels could have a profound impact on coastal populations. \n\n- Natural factors, such as the thermal expansion of warming ocean waters and the melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets, are key contributors to rising sea levels. \n- Human activities, including groundwater depletion, also play a role. \n- The potential collapse of parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, due to direct contact with warming ocean waters, could lead to an additional rise of several tenths of a meter in sea level. \n- Modelling studies offer a range of projections, with one extreme scenario suggesting up to a meter or more of sea-level rise from Antarctica alone by 2100 in a high-emission scenario. \n- The report presents various emission scenarios, including low, medium, and high, with corresponding projected sea-level rises of 44 cm, 53 cm, and 74 cm, respectively, by 2100. \n- An enhanced high scenario, considering rapid ice-sheet discharge, could result in a total global sea-level rise of 139 cm by 2100.", "## Table 7.1: Projected Global Sea-Level Rise By 2100": "The potential impacts of rising sea levels on Canada's coastal regions are significant and pose considerable challenges for adaptation measures. The report highlights an \"extreme\" scenario of a 2.5-meter rise in global sea levels by the end of the century, which, although unlikely, could have severe consequences. This scenario serves as a stress test for policies and plans, ensuring readiness even for low-probability, high-impact events. The marine sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet are particularly unstable, adding to the uncertainties. Such a drastic rise in sea levels would profoundly affect human settlements, economic activities, and coastal ecosystems, underlining the critical importance of proactive and effective adaptation strategies.", "## 7.5.2.2: Vertical Land Motion": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided section of the climate change report: \n\n- Vertical land motion has a significant impact on relative sea-level changes in Canada, as mentioned in the previous section. \n- This motion is largely influenced by glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), which is the process by which the Earth's crust adjusts to the weight of glaciers and ice sheets. \n- The rate of vertical land motion due to GIA is expected to remain similar to the current observed rates, continuing to influence relative sea-level changes in the future. \n\nThus, it is important to consider the impact of vertical land motion when studying and planning for the effects of climate change, particularly in coastal areas where relative sea-level changes can have significant consequences. \n\nOverall, this section emphasizes the long-term and ongoing impact of glacial activity on Canada's geography and sea levels, providing important context for understanding and adapting to the dynamic environment shaped by climate change.", "## 7.5.2.3: Other Effects": "Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text: \n\n- The redistribution of meltwater from glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets varies globally due to the elastic response of the Earth's crust and changes in gravitational attraction as ice masses shrink.\n- These factors, along with calculations of meltwater redistribution, influence relative sea-level change.\n- Ocean currents are associated with variations in \"dynamic\" sea surface topography, and alterations in these currents can impact both absolute and relative sea levels.\n- Projections based on CMIP5 models suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation changes will result in enhanced sea-level rise for northeastern North America, including Atlantic Canada, over the next century.\n\nOverall, the text highlights the complex interplay between melting ice masses, ocean currents, and their impact on sea-level rise, with potential consequences for the North American coastline.", "## 7.5.2.4: Projections Of Relative Sea-Level Change": "Canada's coastal communities are at risk of significant relative sea-level rise due to global sea-level rise and local land motion. Projections indicate that by 2100, sea levels could rise by up to 93 cm in some areas, with the highest projections where the land is currently sinking due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) in Atlantic Canada. Other factors, such as the uplift rate of the land and the loss of Arctic glaciers, also contribute to varying sea-level changes across the country. For instance, in Hudson Bay and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, where the land is uplifting rapidly, a continued sea-level fall is projected. The report highlights four locations with varying vertical crustal motion, from sinking to uplifting, and their projected sea-level changes under different emission scenarios. The enhanced high scenario projects a concerning relative sea-level rise of over 150 cm in Halifax by 2100. Even under a low emission scenario, sea levels are still expected to rise by about 50 cm in Halifax, while falling by more than 100 cm in rapidly uplifting areas. Beyond 2100, global sea-level rise will continue, and relative sea-level changes in Canada are expected to follow similar patterns as in the current century, with potential variations depending on local land motion.", "## 7.5.3: Extreme Water Levels": "- Ocean-surface heights are subject to various fluctuations, influenced by waves, tides, and both atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. \n- These changes can be caused by large-scale internal climate variability, such as ENSO events, which can lead to significant coastal sea-level adjustments. \n- The ENSO cycle's potential intensification due to global warming could result in even higher water levels during El Ni\u00f1o episodes on Canada's western coastline. \n- Superimposed on the tidal cycle, these factors create substantial variability in peak water levels throughout the year and between years. \n- One of the most concerning consequences of rising sea levels is its impact on extreme high coastal water levels and flooding events, often associated with storm surges coinciding with high tides. \n- These surges, reaching over a meter in height above tide levels, are projected to become even higher and more frequent in the future, exacerbating the extent and frequency of coastal flooding.", "## Box 7.5: Storm Surge Flooding": "Canada's coastline is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, particularly storm surges and rising sea levels, which lead to extreme high water-level events. These events have already caused significant flooding and erosion, as seen in British Columbia and Nova Scotia. The combination of low-pressure systems, strong onshore winds, and breaking waves contributes to storm surges, resulting in high water levels during storms and high tides. With sea levels rising in places like Halifax, the frequency of extreme water-level events is expected to increase, posing risks to communities, transportation, and ecosystems. Adaptation measures are necessary, especially in regions with relative sea-level rise, which includes most of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Beaufort coast in the Arctic. The loss of sea ice, a crucial buffer against waves and surges, further exacerbates the problem by allowing larger waves to form and increasing the potential for higher extreme water levels. Overall, the frequency and magnitude of extreme high water-level events are expected to rise, leading to more frequent and severe flooding, infrastructure damage, ecosystem disruption, and coastal erosion.", "# 7.6: Ocean Chemistry": "- Ocean waters surrounding Canada are experiencing increasing acidity due to the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, with the Arctic Ocean acidifying most rapidly.\n- Subsurface oxygen levels have decreased in the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic oceans, partly due to rising upper-ocean temperatures and density stratification associated with climate change. This decrease in oxygen is detrimental to marine life and is expected to become more widespread.\n- Nutrient supply to the ocean surface layer has generally decreased in the North Pacific due to increasing upper-ocean stratification, but no consistent pattern is observed in the Northwest Atlantic.\n- Ocean acidification, dissolved oxygen levels, and nutrient availability are all strongly influenced by physical processes such as vertical mixing and deep convection, which are linked to climate variability and change. \n- The modifications in ocean chemistry have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and may lead to positive feedback loops that amplify atmospheric CO2 concentrations.", "## 7.6.1: Ocean Acidification": "The rising levels of atmospheric CO2 are having a profound impact on our oceans. Here are the key points: \n\n- The ocean has absorbed over a quarter of human-induced CO2 emissions since the Industrial Era, acting as a buffer against climate change. \n- This absorption has altered the ocean's carbon cycle and chemistry, leading to a significant issue known as ocean acidification. \n- Ocean acidification is a direct result of increased CO2 absorption, and it poses a threat to marine life and ecosystems. \n- While the ocean's uptake of CO2 has temporarily slowed anthropogenic climate change, the resulting chemical changes in the ocean are cause for concern and require further investigation and mitigation strategies. \n\nIn summary, the increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is not only warming the planet but also significantly impacting the ocean's chemistry and ecosystems, with potential far-reaching consequences for the planet's health and biodiversity.", "## Box 7.6: Ocean Carbon Cycle": "The ocean plays a crucial role in the Earth's carbon cycle, absorbing and storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. However, the increasing concentration of anthropogenic CO2 is leading to ocean acidification, which has far-reaching consequences for marine ecosystems. This process is particularly pronounced in Canada's marine regions, including the Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic. The key factors influencing the degree of ocean acidification in these regions include natural circulation patterns and human activities. For instance, the Northeast Pacific naturally has high levels of dissolved carbon due to meridional overturning circulation, while coastal areas are affected by freshwater inputs and nutrient runoff, exacerbating acidification. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago and the Canada Basin are among the first ocean regions to exhibit corrosive surface waters, with accelerated ice melt and increased freshwater input contributing to the rise in acidity. Projections indicate that under high emission scenarios, Arctic surface waters could become undersaturated by mid-century, posing significant threats to marine life and ecosystems.", "## 7.6.2: Dissolved Oxygen And Hypoxia": "The ocean's oxygen content is a critical indicator of the health of marine ecosystems, and a decline in oxygen levels can have far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and biological productivity. The text highlights that the increasing global ocean temperatures due to anthropogenic climate change are leading to a decrease in the ocean's oxygen-holding capacity, with a 2% loss since 1960. This loss is attributed to reduced solubility of oxygen with higher temperatures and decreased vertical mixing due to stratification. While human activities, such as nutrient loading, contribute to oxygen depletion in coastal waters, natural factors like eutrophication and physical flushing also play a role. Observations in Canadian waters, particularly off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, show a concerning decline in dissolved oxygen in subsurface waters, with long-term monitoring stations like Station P recording a continuous decrease since 1956. The Arctic Ocean, however, has maintained stable oxygen levels, and even supersaturation in some areas, due to primary production. Projections indicate a few percent loss of dissolved oxygen by the end of the century, but regional variations and the impact on specific ecosystems remain uncertain.", "## 7.6.3: Ocean Nutrients": "Canada's surrounding oceans are experiencing significant changes in nutrient concentrations and ocean properties, providing insights into the broader impact of climate change. Here are the key points: \n\n- Nutrients are essential for algal growth and the health of marine ecosystems, but climate change-induced vertical stratification in Canada's oceans reduces nutrient supply from deep waters to the sunlit surface layer. \n- In the North Pacific Ocean, there is a decreasing trend in phosphate and silicate concentrations, while nitrate levels remain stable. This indicates reduced vertical mixing due to increased stratification, with atmospheric deposition compensating for nitrate levels. \n- The Northwest Atlantic Ocean adjacent to Canada shows complex regional trends, with some areas exhibiting long-term declines in nitrate, silicate, and phosphate, while others show increases or variable trends. \n- Ocean acidification, linked directly to human CO2 emissions, is expected to continue increasing acidity in the upper ocean, with varying projections depending on future emission scenarios. \n- Deoxygenation of the subsurface oceans is evident, likely due to increased stratification from surface warming and freshening, reducing vertical mixing. This trend is projected to continue globally, but with regional variations. \n- The supply of nutrients to the upper ocean may be further impacted by increased stratification, as observed in the North Pacific. \n- The complex and varying trends in nutrient concentrations and ocean properties highlight the dynamic nature of climate change's impact on Canada's marine environments. \n\nThese changes in nutrient availability and ocean conditions have significant implications for marine life and the overall health of Canada's surrounding seas.", "## 8.1: Introduction": "Canada's Changing Climate Report offers a comprehensive overview of the country's changing climate and its impacts.

The key pieces of evidence include rising air and sea surface temperatures, increasing ocean heat content, and declining snow and ice coverage. These changes cannot be explained by natural factors but are strongly linked to human influences. \n\n- The dominant contributor to climate change is the accumulation of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. \n- Quantitative studies strongly support this, concluding that it is 'extremely likely' that human activities, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, have caused the observed global warming since the 20th century. \n- Further warming is inevitable, but the extent depends on future emissions, with net-zero emissions stabilizing temperatures. \n- Canada's future climate depends on the speed and effectiveness of emissions reduction measures. \n- By the end of the 21st century, global temperatures are projected to increase by a further 1\u00baC to 3.7\u00baC, depending on the emission scenario, with significant implications for impacts and risks. \n- To align with the Paris Agreement, immediate and drastic emissions reductions are necessary to limit warming to below 2\u00baC above pre-industrial levels.", "## 8.3: Changes Across Canada": "Canada's climate is closely intertwined with global climate patterns, and the country is experiencing the effects of global climate change.
